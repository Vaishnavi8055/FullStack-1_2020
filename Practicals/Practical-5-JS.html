    <p style="background-color: gray; color: white;">Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
        “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help. But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called
        ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine. The browser has an embedded
        engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.
